# Application of Extended Kalman Filter to Orbit Determiation

The extended Kalman filter was applied to an initial orbit determination problem done by non-linear weighted least squares method in order to improve the error ellipsoid.

## Presentation

Please visit: https://portfolium.com/entry/extended-kalman-filter-in-orbit-determination for the presentation on how this code was developed.

## Code

The main script can run on its own to generate the solution, but I have also included all the functions separately as well.
